#### Claire Gaulin-Brown was raised in a small cabin tucked away in Vancouver Island’s rustic Cowichan Valley. This naturally beautiful setting leant to an upbringing that gave Claire the initial push into an artistic career based on a deep, intuitive understanding of the way humans interact with their environment.

#### Through relentless education and outdoor exploration, Claire has learned the many faces of the interaction between our planet and its inhabitants. In her artwork, Claire demonstrates these many faces as beautiful, destructive, hopeful, and helpless. Her work is reminiscent of a children’s fairytale illustration, with almost macabre undertones in order to bring these faces of conflict and connections to life.
